          <h1>Parker solar Probe</h1>
          <p>
          Parker Solar Probe launched in 2018 to explore the mysteries of the Sun by traveling closer to it than any spacecraft before. Three years after launch and decades after its conception, Parker finally arrived.
          Unlike Earth, the Sun doesnt have a solid surface. But it does have a superheated atmosphere made of solar material bound to the Sun by gravity and magnetic forces. As rising heat and pressure push that material away from the Sun, there is a point in space where gravity and magnetic fields are too weak to contain it.
          That point, known as the Alfvén critical surface, marks the end of the solar atmosphere and the beginning of the solar wind. Solar material with the energy to make it across that boundary becomes the solar wind, which drags the magnetic field of the Sun with it as it races across the solar system to Earth and beyond.

            Until now, researchers were unsure exactly where the Alfvén critical surface lay. Based on remote images of the corona, estimates had put it somewhere between 10 to 20 solar radii (4.3 to 8.6 million miles) from the surface of the Sun. Parker’s spiral trajectory brings it slowly closer to the Sun and during its previous few passes, the spacecraft was consistently below 20 solar radii (91 percent of Earth’s distance from the Sun), putting it in the position to cross the boundary – assuming the estimates were correct.
          On April 28, 2021, during its eighth flyby of the Sun, Parker Solar Probe encountered the specific magnetic and particle conditions at 18.8 solar radii (around 8.1 million miles) above the solar surface that told scientists it had crossed the Alfvén critical surface for the first time and finally entered the solar atmosphere to “touch the Sun.”

          Parker Solar Probe launched in 2018 to explore the mysteries of the Sun by traveling closer to it than any spacecraft before. Three years after launch and decades after its conception, Parker finally arrived.
          You will be NASA's newly hired engineer with the task of designing the Parker Solar Probe.
          We hope you learn about its amazing achivements and how important Parker is to our understanding of the Sun.
